            The city shimmered beneath a veil of embers, and Lira could hear the bells of the harbor
            echoing through the smoke. She turned the sigil in her palm, remembering the promise she made
            to the council: return with answers, not more mysteries.

            She crossed the bridge into the Ashen Gate where merchants whispered of a hidden chapter,
            sealed behind gold and trust. If she unlocked it, the paywall would fall for everyone who
            believed in her story.

            Behind her, the flare of the phoenix mark pulsed. It was time to decide whether she was an
            author of endings or beginnings.

              "Stories are gates. Some are locked by fear, others by coin. But every gate has a true name."
              The words followed her beneath the hanging lanterns as she stepped deeper into the market.
              Every stallkeeper traded in fragments: a line of prophecy, a memory wrapped in wax, a map drawn
              in ash.

              Lira pressed onward until the stone avenue opened into a chamber where the gate itself waited,
              engraved with names from forgotten chapters. She placed her hand on the center sigil, and the
              letters began to glow one by one like rising embers.
            </p>
            <p>
              The lock cracked. Not with force, but with recognition. The gate read her story back to her,
              then lifted. Beyond it, pages stretched in a long vertical corridor, each one waiting to be
              read, one after another, without interruption.
